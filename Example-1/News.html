    <p><h2>
        Google has begun testing changes to the way companies are able to track users online.
        </h2>
    </p>
    <p>A new feature in the Chrome browser disables third-party cookies - small files stored on your device to collect analytic data, personalise online ads and monitor browsing.
    </p>
    <p>
        It will initially be available to 1% of global users, about 30 million people.
    </p>
    <p> Google describes the changes as a test, with plans for a full rollout to eliminate cookies later this year.
    </p>    
    <p>However, some advertisers say they will suffer as a result.</p>
    <p>
    Google's Chrome is the world's most popular internet browser.
    </p>
    <p>
    Rivals such as Apple's Safari and Mozilla Firefox - which account for far less internet traffic - already include options to block third-party cookies.
    </p>
    <p>Google says randomly-chosen users will be asked if they want to "browse with more privacy".</p>
    <p>
    Anthony Chavez, Google vice president,<b><u>said in a blog post</u></b>: "We're taking a responsible approach to phasing out third-party cookies in Chrome.
    
    <p>"If a site doesn't work without third-party cookies and Chrome notices you're having issues... we'll prompt you with an option to temporarily re-enable third-party cookies for that website."
    </p>

    <p>
    Cookies can be used to record various kinds of data about users including:
<ul>
    <li>what you do on the site</li>
    <li>whereabouts in the world you are</li>
    <li>what device you are using</li>
    <li>where you go online afterwards</li>
</ul>
    <p>
    "Google's solution, the Chrome Privacy Sandbox, which only works on a Chrome browser, likely doesn't benefit anyone other than Google," said Phil Duffield, UK vice president at The Trade Desk, which operates a platform for companies to buy ads online.
